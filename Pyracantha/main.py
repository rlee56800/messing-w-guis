Little monologue about Pyracantha jam
'''
text = [["That's Pyracantha, fire thorn."],
["Don't eat the seeds, they contain cyanide."], 
["The flesh doesn't taste too good, either."], 
["I heard they taste real good as jam."], 
["...but of course it would taste good, jam is just fruit with an obscene amount of sugar."], 
["Why spend all that time straining seeds from a tiny berry when you can use domesticated fruit..."]]
